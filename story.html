        <p id="firstP"> Hello My name is Rachel and I am ten year old. I have a brother and his name is Ethan. My birthday is May 26 2010. When I have free time I would like to go swimming or to bake. Since there is corona I won't be able to do swimming so I d baking. My favorite color is aqua  and my favorite food is pizza, burger, pasta, and chicken. I like to travel to places that are hot like Florida, Miami, India, Ohio and many more. I always live to bake for my family or friends. My favorite holiday is Christmas, Easter, Birthdays, Valentines Day, and Independence Day.  </p>
